## 🎯 Goal of the Home Page

## 📌 Sections Overview

### 1. **Hero Section**
- **Heading:** "Bringing Transparency to Venture Capital"
- **Subheading:** "A trusted platform for founders to rate and review VCs anonymously."
- **CTA Buttons:** `Write a Review` | `Explore Reviews`
- **Visual:** Illustration or animation (glassdoor-style, founders talking, etc.)

### 2. **Problem / Why It Matters**
- Use short bullet-style text or illustrations:
  - The VC world lacks transparency.
  - Founders rely on backchannel DMs to assess investors.
  - Negative experiences often go unreported.
  - Founders deserve a voice.

### 3. **How It Works**
- 3 or 4 steps visual layout:
  1. Sign up & verify identity confidentially.
  2. Submit anonymized reviews of VCs.
  3. Browse insights & find the right partner.
  4. VCs can respond & build better reputations.

### 4. **Key Features**
- Anonymous & Verified Reviews
- Ratings on criteria: responsiveness, fairness, support
- Community-driven transparency
- Optional Q&A between founders

### 5. **Testimonials / Community Voices**
- Quotes from fictional founders (can be real later)
- Reinforce value and trust

### 6. **Get Started CTA**
- Prominent section with call to action: `Join the Founder Community`
- Short sign-up input or button
